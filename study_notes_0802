1. Guideline2
2. 1.25X for videos 
3. each pratice 5X times 
4. study graph + practice  

studying structure for data structure: 
(1) First Dimension: array/list stack/linkedlist/map/set 
(2) Second Dimension: Tree Graph / BST (ordered tree), AVL heap, disjoint set, Trie/ 
(3) Speical: Bitwise, bloomfilter LRU Cache 

Algos: The simplistic rule about all the algos is that all the complication can boil down to simple rules (if-else (logic flow)) 
(1) if-else
(2) for, which, while loop 
(3) recursion (divide and conquer) 

Search/ BFS/DFS 
Dynamic Programming 
Binary Search

MindNote for all the structual learning 

How to solve a question:
1. Clarification 
2. Possible Solutions 
   compare time space 
3. coding 
4. test cases 

5 * 5 practice: 
1. 5 min understand the question max 15 mins 
2. compare the solutions 
3. remember + repeat 
4. leetcode (space + time) 
5. One Day/ One Week/ pre-interview
